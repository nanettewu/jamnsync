","the two areas that were hardest to follow were 1. navigating the recording page without someone walking me through it the first time (particularly lower left corner where the record/stop/play buttons for both solo and group exist, not as intuitive as to which ones i want to use when multiple tracks exist) and 2. using the alignment tool (how do i know which peak to align the bar with? first peak vs. fourth peak? sometimes the peaks are thick - do i align at the beginning or middle or end of peak). for non-professionals, including some preface as to why the alignment tool is useful/what the purpose is could be helpful.","just curious - what does the recording page look like when there are many tracks? could be inconvenient to scroll to the bottom each time to record, can consider moving master controls as a panel off to the right that sticks as you scroll. buttons can be larger + colored + more contrasting border + keep font consistent + delete take button is slightly thicker than download take i think. overall, it's a unique and cool webapp and i'm proud of the amount of time, energy, and thought you've put into it + what you've accomplished so far! good job nanette : ) "

Dragging makes much more sense.  Also, the collaborative aspects of the JamNSync platform are a unified alternative to sending and receiving tracks via Facebook, GDrive, and email.  It is much less of a hassle than real-time low-latency softwares such as Soundjack which have technical requirements for using them.",4,"I still might want to use JamNSync when people are far away, when I am trying to record myself with myself (which does not have the capability to happen in real life), or when I want to do a quick no-hassle rehearsal or ""sketch"" without travelling to meet someone.  However, it is difficult to perform as musically on JamNSync immediately because of the requirement of a backing track or a person with strong understanding of the tempo of the piece (often musicians will react to each other during a piece to negotiate tempo).","Audio alignment tool is genius!  The buttons and interface are very simple which is an advantage.  I also liked the ability to preview my finished product (play with volumes, mute tracks, delete tracks, etc) natively.  I thought the near-real-time online indicator for my musician partner was also neat.  I think calling recordings ""Takes"" really helps me understand their role.  Login was also really easy.","There is little feedback for incoming updates from my partner (if they are uploading a track, waiting to perform a group audio action, or stopped recording), especially when I am looking down to study my music (i.e., would prefer audio feedback in some cases).  There is no ability to re-align tracks even by re-uploading them.  It is sometimes confusing to have to create a project in a group rather than create one as the first action taken on the platform.  It is also confusing that tracks change over time (i.e., Parts would make more sense ? ).  Load times were a little slow.  When attempting to align a track in which I did not sing immediately (Soprano track which rests for first 2 measures), it was frustrating for 2 reasons: (1) Need to be able to amplify Soprano track to distinguish it from the backing track, and (2) Prefer to be able to start listening to alignment when Soprano starts singing rather than beginning of track.  Frustrations with alignment tool were voiced.","Alignment of tracks is a major pain point for mixing of asynchronous recordings, which is at least partially addressed by this app, making this app very useful.  It was exciting to discover the capabilities of the app during the user test.  Generally a bit more UI work is warranted (including more indicators), but make sure to keep the great simplicity going."

And hearing things live is the best way to receive audio. However, JamNSync is handy for keeping recordings, and also hearing how a group sounds from not being a player within the group.

Soundjack disconnected all of the time and when it was working there was too much of a delay to rehearse synchronously. When we rehearsed in Zoom we couldn't really get anything done.

I think the idea of just using something like this instead is better.,2,Playing with people in person just can't be beat. The experience is so much better than playing together online. You can also adjust on the fly to what someone else is doing which is impossible with something like this.,"I think in general the whole system was pretty intuitive and worked pretty well. Setting up a group and a project was pretty easy, and it was nice to be able to see who was logged onto the project as well. Recording makes sense too and works well. Everything on the whole is easy to understand.","There's no way to see where in the song you are/how far you are in the backing track. It would be nice if there was some progress bar for that. The alignment is also a bit annoying because you have to start from the beginning every time you click play. If a person comes in a bit late, the alignment process can be rather frustrating as you wait for playback to reach the spot you just came in on.","The biggest thing that would stop me from using this is the inability to loop a given section. If you wanted to check a specific section you would have to record all the way from the beginning, which would be frustrating especially if you just wanted to run a tricky part over and over again which is a lot of what rehearsing consists of."

I can't speak to how intuitive/easy it was to use because I was already used to using a DAW by that point, and Bandlab was similar enough to Reaper that I figured it out pretty quickly. Maybe since JamNSync is stripped down, it's more understandable to someone who hasn't worked with music production?",6,6,"Yes, just a skim.",5,5,5,4,5,usb mic,professional wired,The backing track quality was great and I thought recording over it was pretty easy. Some clicks and a really high pitched frequency in my track. Also the problem with aligning over multiple tracks,4,"Honestly, I very much prefer in-person rehearsal, and in the absence of that, I'd rather just practice on my own and not have to deal with the overhead of working through a website (particularly things like aligning audio and communicating about when to start/stop recording). Since we're all on Zoom, we can give each other verbal cues like ""Okay, I'm about to press start,"" but it would feel very detached and maybe a bit bewildering to be working on JamNSync without some other channel of live communication going on simultaneously. Like, you just wait until someone presses group record / group play? And sit there in silence otherwise?

Another thought is that it's pretty common in rehearsal to stop in the middle of a runthrough to practice a particular section, which isn't an option on JamNSync as it exists now. So using JamNSync would be less like a regular rehearsal and more like a pre-performance runthrough.",1,I feel like my answer to the previous question sums up why I would prefer to rehearse in-person.,"I think the UI is pretty intuitive (the alignment part is probably the least so, but that's a difficult one to design), and the workflow was simple enough. I was impressed by the quality of the audio.","Nothing was frustrating in the sense that I got angry/upset (which has happened with other remote technologies lol). There are things that would have been nice to add on, but I'll put those in the next section","- Visual feedback to know that you're recording (ellipses like a text message bubble or something maybe?)
- Adjustable time before recording (it's set at three seconds, but that might be a little too short for someone depending on their instrument or set-up)
- Playback from any part of the track for alignment (like have an anchored cursor in the middle for aligning where you want to start in the backing track, and the backing track moves?)
- Make hovering over the moveable things the finger instead of the mouse"

We talked about soundjack, but no one was willing to set this up, and it was confusing. Also used garageband and audacity for recordings. Audacity seemed to have a steep learning curve and wasn't easy to use. Not everyone had macs, so garageband wasn't always an option. Both of these options also involved sending many files back and forth which was slow. We also tried Zoom, which was the most limiting because we just had everyone play to one person while muted. JamNSync was easy to pick up and did not require long set up (just needed to put in google account), and it seemed pretty straightforward to layer tracks quickly in real time which is useful for rehearsals (takes care of the long wait times that limit garageband/audacity, which could be used instead only for final recordings).",4,4,"Yes, just a skim.",7,7,5,7,6,airpods,airpods,"Audio quality was very good, even considering poor mic (airpods).

In my experiences rehearsing remotely, the other options were inconvenient or limiting. For bandlab and soundjack, the setup was extensive and confusing. For sending files back and forth on garageband/audacity, and sometimes dropbox messed up the files while updating. For zoom real-time rehearsals, you could only hear one part at a time which gets time consuming for larger groups.",3,"It depends on convenience level for meeting in person, but in general meeting in person would probably be more efficient. I think there could be a place for JamNSync if there's limited in-person rehearsal time, and there's specific sections that need to be practiced together (e.g. something like Messiaen mvmt. 4 part F lol)",I like the simplicity and that you can immediately get started without being confused by some lengthy setup process. The alignment feature between the backing track and and recording was great. It is also cool that everything updates in real time so you can work on it at the same time as the rest of the group.,"I think the group record functions made sense eventually, but maybe a small demo on how it works would be helpful (so giving instructions on when/why you would use the group record). ","Still think it would be useful to have a seeking feature for playing tracks and maybe having the track alignment as a constant feature so you can drag and adjust later on as well. And for the track alignment with multiple parts at the same time, to have each part on a separate line (though it was clear in my test, I could see how the stacking of several tracks with metronome into one part could potentially be difficult to align). Could be useful to have an explanation on the best way to use the app (like that you want to record tracks individually, and then you can try recording again while hearing the other parts at the same time).

I think it is a much nicer experience compared to what we have been doing in the MITWE chamber groups so far, which is recording separately and then spending all of our zoom meetings just piecing the recordings together in a DAW. For JamNSync to work, we would probably need the ability to re-record just portions of a piece (rather than the entire piece each time), and specific parts.",1,"I really miss playing with other people in person 😢
Live music is such a different experience. It is really hard to replicate the immediate feedback that you get in a live setting. People automatically adjust their pitch, tone, and intensity to each other and it makes such a big difference.","I think the basic idea is good, and saving / uploading the files as pretty seamless.","Having to manually align the tracks. This might be a necessity because of the latency of the audio input and web browser, but I wish it wasn't. Alignment can be really difficult for a variety of reasons (the backing track can be hard to sync to, the player might be slightly late on their first note, etc.) It always feels like guess work no matter how hard the user tries, and its frustrating because they know this.

Nearly all of the buttons could be easier to click on. Try playing around with the placement and sizing. Often times the most important buttons are difficult to click and not prominent enough.

The overall navigation and visual hierarchy of the pages is a bit confusing. The home page doesn't seem very useful. Once I was on the main page for a project, it wasn't clear from  the navbar or the headers where I was in the app.","The overall flow of the app could be a little bit smoother. For a first time user, it's not always clear what the next step is supposed to be. The login button, for example, is hidden away at the top right corner. When the alignment modal pops up, the instructions for what to do are pretty clear, but there is no explanation for why I have to do it in the first place. Some of the buttons don't make sense until all users have selected a track, and it would be nice to guide the user to naturally do so instead of displaying and error message after they try to click the record button."
